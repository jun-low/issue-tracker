This project is a RESTful API server built with Node.js and [Express](https://expressjs.com/), along with a [Angular](https://angular.dev/) application to interact with the server. The server application provides endpoints for managing issues, while the Angular application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) issue.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Development server

1. Run `npm run dev:server` or `npm start` for a dev server. The server will start running on `http://localhost:3000`.

2. In a separate terminal window, direct to the `app/client` and run the Angular application by typing `ng serve`. Open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
